# Solar Powered Self-Driving Car Project

This group project involved the development of a solar-powered, self-driving car to compete in a competition on a black and white race track. The car utilized IR sensors to read the color of the track underneath it and navigate through the course. 
The project aimed to compete in the "Best 3D-print" and "Best ECO-Design" categories.

## Components Used
- Two DC motors
- Solar panel
- H-bridge
- One Arduino UNO
- Two IR sensors

## Challenges Faced
- Size (dimensions) limitations
- Power supply from the solar panel

## Approach
- Individual sketches were made to explore various design possibilities
- Selected one sketch for further development, which was then turned into a CAD model
- CAD was used for precise design and visualization
- The car was completely 3D-printed using 100% recycled material, except for the electrical components
- Integrated friction fittings were used for all electrical components
- Programming the Arduino was straightforward once the circuit schematics for the car were finalized
- A project plan was created to stay organized and set clear deadlines
- Weekly meetings were held to brainstorm solutions to encountered problems

## Results
- On the day of the competition, the car weighed 206.35 grams and completed the track in 71.49 seconds
- The group did not aim to win the "Lightest car" or "Faster car" sub-competitions but were satisfied with the overall result

## Additional Notes
- Include any additional information or insights gained from the project
- Provide acknowledgments or credits to individuals or organizations that contributed to the project
